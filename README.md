# sublinear-graphs
This repository contains sublinear algorithms for graphs using the `petgraph` library. 
All of these algorithms are correct with some probability for a graph which obeys a given property, and generally scale in runtime with the inverse of 
a parameter `Îµ`, where said parameter is used to define a property of the graph.
